## Reporting a Vulnerability

Use this section to tell people how to report a vulnerability.

Tell them where to go, how often they can expect to get an update on a
reported vulnerability, what to expect if the vulnerability is accepted or
declined, etc.

1. To report a security vulnerability, [open an issue](https://github.com/ivanoblomov/google_maps_geocoder/issues/new/choose).
2. Updates are made within 48 hours.
3. If the vulnerability is accepted, we'll try to patch it within a week.
