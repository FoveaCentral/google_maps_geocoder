# Goal
Explain this issue's purpose. Focus on the problem that needs to be solved and *not* a particular solution. For example: "Make it easier for users to reset their passwords."

# Description
1. Provide as much background as you need to familiarize the implementer with the problem to be solved.
2. Include:
    * screenshots
    * links to other issues or pull requests

# Success Criteria
How would a stakeholder test whether the feature was completed successfully?
