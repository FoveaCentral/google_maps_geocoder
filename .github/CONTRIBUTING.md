# How to contribute

## **New to open-source?**

Try your hand at one of the small tasks ideal for new or casual contributors that are [up-for-grabs](https://github.com/ivanoblomov/google_maps_geocoder/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Aup-for-grabs). Welcome to the community!

## **Did you find a bug?**

1. **Ensure the bug was not already reported** by searching on GitHub under [Issues](https://github.com/ivanoblomov/google_maps_geocoder/issues).

2. If you're unable to find an open issue addressing the problem, [open a new one](https://github.com/ivanoblomov/google_maps_geocoder/issues/new). Be sure to include:
    1. a **title and clear description**
    2. as much **relevant information** as possible
    3. a **code sample** or an **executable test case** demonstrating the expected behavior that is not occurring.

## **Did you write a patch that fixes a bug or adds a new feature?**

1. **Add specs** that either *reproduce the bug* or *cover the new feature*. In the former's case, *make sure it fails without the fix!*

2. **Confirm your last build passes** on your GitHub branch or PR.

3. **Update the inline documentation.** Format it with [YARD](http://www.rubydoc.info/gems/yard/file/docs/GettingStarted.md). For example, see [`GoogleMapsGeocoder.new`](https://github.com/ivanoblomov/google_maps_geocoder/blob/github-templates/lib/google_maps_geocoder/google_maps_geocoder.rb#L43-L50).

4. [Open a pull request](https://github.com/ivanoblomov/google_maps_geocoder/compare) with the patch or feature. Follow the template's directions.

## Developer Certificate of Origin (DCO)

All contributions (including pull requests) must agree to the [Developer Certificate of Origin (DCO) version 1.1](https://developercertificate.org). This is a developer's certification that he or she has the right to submit the patch for inclusion into the project.

Simply submitting a contribution implies this agreement, however, please include a `Signed-off-by` tag in the PR (this tag is a conventional way to confirm that you agree to the DCO).

It's not practical to fix old contributions in git, so if one is forgotten, do not try to fix them.  We presume that if someone sometimes used a DCO, a commit without a DCO is an accident and the DCO still applies.

## Thanks for contributing!
