# How to contribute

## **Did you find a bug?**

1. **Ensure the bug was not already reported** by searching on GitHub under [Issues](https://github.com/ivanoblomov/google_maps_geocoder/issues).

2. If you're unable to find an open issue addressing the problem, [open a new one](https://github.com/ivanoblomov/google_maps_geocoder/issues/new). Be sure to include:
    1. a **title and clear description**
    2. as much **relevant information** as possible
    3. a **code sample** or an **executable test case** demonstrating the expected behavior that is not occurring.

## **Did you write a patch that fixes a bug or adds a new feature?**

1. **Add specs** that either reproduces the bug or covers the new feature. In the former's case, *make sure it fails without the fix!*

2. **Confirm your last build passes** on [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org/ivanoblomov/google_maps_geocoder/branches).

3. **Update the inline documentation.** Format it with [YARD](http://www.rubydoc.info/gems/yard/file/docs/GettingStarted.md). For example, see [`GoogleMapsGeocoder.new`](https://github.com/ivanoblomov/google_maps_geocoder/blob/github-templates/lib/google_maps_geocoder/google_maps_geocoder.rb#L43-L50).

4. [Open a pull request](https://github.com/ivanoblomov/google_maps_geocoder/compare) with the patch or feature. Follow the template's directions.
