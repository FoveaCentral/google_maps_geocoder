# How to contribute

## **Did you find a bug?**

1. **Ensure the bug was not already reported** by searching on GitHub under [Issues](https://github.com/ivanoblomov/google_maps_geocoder/issues).

2. If you're unable to find an open issue addressing the problem, [open a new one](https://github.com/ivanoblomov/google_maps_geocoder/issues/new). Be sure to include:
    1. a **title and clear description**
    2. as much relevant information as possible
    3. a **code sample** or an **executable test case** demonstrating the expected behavior that is not occurring.

## **Did you write a patch that fixes a bug or adds a new feature?**

1. Confirm your last build passes on [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org/ivanoblomov/google_maps_geocoder/branches).

2. Make sure the inline [YARD documentation](http://www.rubydoc.info/gems/yard/file/docs/GettingStarted.md) is up to date.

3. Open a new GitHub pull request with the patch or feature.

4. Ensure the PR description clearly describes the problem and solution or new feature. Include the relevant issue number if applicable.
